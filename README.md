"Simplified Conditional Diffusion Model for Protein Structure Prediction
This repository contains a Python demonstration of conditional diffusion processes inspired by those used in advanced protein structure prediction models like AlphaFold 3. The code simulates the basics of how conditioning data can influence the prediction of 3D protein structures, using simplified one-dimensional data and noise models. It's designed as an educational tool to help understand the fundamentals of diffusion models in bioinformatics."

I. Development Goal:
The objective is to create a demonstration program that provides insight into how conditional diffusion models work, particularly in the context of applications like Alpha Fold 3. This program aims to mimic the processes through which AlphaFold 3 predicts the three-dimensional XYZ coordinates of protein complexes, utilizing conditional diffusion based on tensor inputs.

II. Program Assumptions and Intuitions:
The demo program operates under several simplifications and assumptions. While these assumptions might lead to results that are numerically unrealistic or limited, they serve an educational purpose by offering a basic understanding of how diffusion models incorporate conditioning. The program simplifies the complexity of diffusion processes by using basic noise addition and reduction techniques, and by introducing a simplistic form of conditioning data that impacts noise estimation and adjustment.

III. Complexity and Neglected Factors:
The actual implementation of models like AlphaFold 3 is significantly more intricate than our demo. Key complexities and factors neglected in the demo include:

Multi-dimensional conditioning: Real-world models often use high-dimensional data and complex tensors that represent a wide array of biological and chemical properties, far beyond the simple scalar conditioning used in the demo.
Dynamic parameter adjustment: Unlike the static parameters in the demo, real models typically involve dynamically adjusting parameters, learning rates, and other elements based on advanced algorithms and feedback mechanisms.
Accuracy and computational resources: AlphaFold 3 and similar models use extensive computational resources to process large datasets, leveraging sophisticated algorithms to achieve high accuracy, which are beyond the scope of this simple Python demonstration.
